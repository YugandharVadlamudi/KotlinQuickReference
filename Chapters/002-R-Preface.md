# Preface

Since 2011 I’ve been using the [Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org/), which I fell in love with as soon as I saw it, so much so that I wrote three books about it:

- [Scala Cookbook](http://kbhr.co/hk-ckbk)
- [Functional Programming, Simplified](http://kbhr.co/hk-fps)
- [Hello, Scala](http://kbhr.co/hk-hs)

The *only* problem I have with Scala is that I enjoy developing Android applications, and with the exception of the [Scala on Android project](http://scala-android.org/) — which, at the time of this writing, hasn’t been updated in 18 months) — there isn’t a simple way to create Android applications with Scala. So when I looked into [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and saw that it was very similar to Scala, well, I was pretty happy.



## What I love about Kotlin

What I love about both Scala and Kotlin can be summed up this way:

- The syntax is as elegant and concise as Ruby
- Everything feels dynamic, but the languages are statically typed
- Source code compiles to class files that run on the JVM
- You can use all of the thousands of Java libraries in existence
- Just as I’ve seen with Scala, the Kotlin creators state that as a rough estimate, Kotlin requires about 40% fewer lines of code than Java

My goal in this book is to provide a quick reference to the Kotlin language. I hope to share not just the nuts and bolts of the Kotlin language, but also its elegance.



## Kotlin overview

Before jumping into the examples, here are a few important things to know about Kotlin:

- It’s a high-level language
- It’s statically typed
- It’s syntax is concise but still readable — we call it *expressive*
- It supports the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm
- It supports the functional programming (FP) paradigm
- It has a sophisticated type inference system
- Kotlin code results in *.class* files that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- It’s easy to use Java libraries in Kotlin
- Kotlin doesn’t have its own collections classes, it just provides extensions to the Java collections classes



## About this book

This book originally started as a light introduction to the Kotlin language. However, as it evolved I thought it would be much better if it was a quick reference, similar in style to the book, [Scala for the Impatient](https://amzn.to/2RXkRmV), or like the O’Reilly “Nutshell” books.

This is also an early release of the book, so some of the writing style is inconsistent. Some lessons are written in an “introduction” style, others are written in a “Nutshell” style. In the long term all lessons will be written in the Nutshell style, with lots of source code examples and few words.
