# Preface


## Release information

This is Release 0.1 of Kotlin Quick Reference.



## Loving Scala ... and Kotlin

Since 2011 I’ve been using the [Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org/). I fell in love with as soon as I saw it, so much so that I wrote three books about it:

- [Scala Cookbook](http://kbhr.co/hk-ckbk)
- [Functional Programming, Simplified](http://kbhr.co/hk-fps)
- [Hello, Scala](http://kbhr.co/hk-hs)

The *only* problem I have with Scala is that I enjoy developing Android applications, and with the exception of the [Scala on Android project](http://scala-android.org/) — which hasn’t had a new release since February 24, 2017 — there isn’t a simple way to create Android applications with Scala. So when I looked into [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and saw that it was very similar to Scala, well, I was pretty happy.



## What I love about Kotlin

What I love about both Kotlin (and Scala) can be summed up this way:

- The syntax is as elegant and concise as Ruby
- Everything feels dynamic, but it’s statically typed
- Source code compiles to class files that run on the JVM
- You can use all of the thousands of Java libraries in existence
- Just as I’ve seen with Scala, the Kotlin creators state that as a rough estimate, Kotlin requires about 40% fewer lines of code than Java
- Developing Android applications with Kotlin is just as easy (easier!) as creating Android applications with Java



## Goal of this book

While there are now many good Kotlin books available, and the documentation on the Kotlin website is excellent, I’ve found that what I want is a *quick reference* to the Kotlin language. Having used multiple programming languages before — including Scala — I don’t need a lot of discussion about a new language, I mostly just need to see the language’s syntax and some good examples.

Therefore, my goal in this book is to provide a quick reference to the Kotlin language — light on words, and heavy on demonstrating syntax and examples.



## The history of this book

This book originally started as a light introduction to the Kotlin language, similar to my own [“Hello, Scala” book](https://amzn.to/2rfGeET), whose goal is to help programmers learn Scala fast. However, as I was working on it I realized that what I wanted was a quick reference, similar in style to the O’Reilly “Nutshell” books, or the book, [Scala for the Impatient](https://amzn.to/2RXkRmV).

Therefore, I started converting my original “Hello, Kotlin” book into this Kotlin Quick Reference. Because of that, and because this is also a very early release of the book, some of the writing style is inconsistent. Some lessons — especially the early lessons — are written in a “Hello, Kotlin” tutorial style, while others are written in a “Nutshell” style. My goal is that in the long term all lessons will be written in the Nutshell style, with lots of source code examples and few words.
