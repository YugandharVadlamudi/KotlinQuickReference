# Summary

I hope you enjoyed this introduction to the Kotlin programming language, and I hope I was able to share some of the beauty of the language.

To learn more about Kotlin, here are some of the best resources I know. First, as a special mention, [Programming in Scala](http://amzn.to/2fiqDBh) is written by Martin Odersky (creator of Scala), Bill Venners (creator of ScalaTest and more), and Lex Spoon, and I consider it to be *the* reference for the Scala language.

My other books on Kotlin are:

- [Kotlin Cookbook](http://amzn.to/24ivK4G)
- [Functional Programming, Simplified](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/functional-programming-simplified-book)

The Cookbook shares the most common recipes for working with Kotlin, and the second book attempts to make learning functional programming as simple as possible.

In alphabetical order, Iâ€™ve read these other books, and I can recommend them:

- [Akka Concurrency](http://amzn.to/2xhUNd4)
- [Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling](http://amzn.to/2iOT3Vh)
- [Functional Programming in Kotlin](http://amzn.to/2sbY1hE)
- [Java Concurrency in Practice](http://amzn.to/2fdFfSK)
- [Learning Concurrent Programming in Kotlin](http://amzn.to/2fWn70c)
- [Scala for the Impatient](http://amzn.to/2HlXBKZ) is a good quick reference guide
