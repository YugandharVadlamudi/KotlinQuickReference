To-Do List
==========

This is a list of features that still need to be added to the book.

- Add the license agreement and copyright statement

- Android coverage

- Kotlin documentation

- `as` operator for casting
    - safe casting with `as?`
        val location: Any = "London"
        val safeString: String? = location as? String
        val safeInt: Int? = location as? Int

- `is` operator
- `in` operator, which i use with `when`

- discuss class hierarchies (Any, Unit, Collections):
    - per docs (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/collections.html), List inherits from Collection<T> and that in turn inherits from Iterable<T>
    - `val location: Any = "London"`

- note that you can also use Javaâ€™s Optional:
    val optionalName: Optional<String> = Optional.of("william")
    val empty: Optional<String> = Optional.empty()

- String? vs Optional:
    fun lookupAddress(postcode: String): String?
    fun lookupAddress(postcode: String): Optional<String>

- other operators, keywords, and functions:
    - apply
    - run
    - let
    - lazy
    - with
    - use
    - repeat
    - require

- Coroutines (async programming)
